<h2 class="about-phead">Our Story</h2>
<p class="about-p">Summit Beverages on Tap was created for one reason, to get great beverages to the people of Fort Wayne, Indiana. We search the community to find beverages made locally and make it possible for them to be served in local offices, events, or right inside your home. Our vision came from visiting area farmers markets and events and being inspired by the growing community of makers who work every day to provide you with nothing but the best. Working directly with our beverage manufactures allows us to be involved throughout the whole process to make sure you're getting the best beverages the city has to offer. We currently are working with non-alcoholic drink crafters only, but plan to expand to alcoholic drinks in the near future. We encourage you to follow us on social media to stay up to date with the latest information from us. Feel free to send us a message via our contact page and weâ€™ll get you connected to one of our beverage specialist as soon as possible. </p>
