# Summit Beverages on Tap
 The website for Summit Beverages on Tap was a concept business webpage that I had created in a class to show my JavaScript skills. While there is a ton of things I would change about the design of this website if I were to launch it, the focus of this website was to follow a rubric and show my ability to create JavaScript objects, manipulate the DOM, utilize web-storage, call a PHP script, and implement AJAX.
